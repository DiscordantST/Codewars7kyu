7 kyu

- Vowel Count:
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

- Disemvowel Trolls:
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

- Square Every Digit:
Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9 in quare is 81 and 1 in square is 1.
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

- Highest and Lowest:
In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
Examples
high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

- Descending Order:
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in
descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421
Input: 145263 Output: 654321
Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321
