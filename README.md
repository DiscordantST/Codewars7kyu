My learning Python from Codewars
7 kyu

- Vowel Count:

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

- Disemvowel Trolls:

Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

- Square Every Digit:

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9 in quare is 81 and 1 in square is 1.
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

- Highest and Lowest:

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
Examples
high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

- Descending Order:

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in
descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421
Input: 145263 Output: 654321
Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

- Get the Middle Character:

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word.
If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
#Examples:
Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"
Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"
Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"
Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
#Input
A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some
test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this.
This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.
#Output
The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

- Mumbling:

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:
Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

- You're a square!:

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle!
Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait!
That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words,
it is the product of some integer with itself.
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
isSquare (-1) // => false
isSquare   3  // => false
isSquare   4  // => true
isSquare  25  // => true
isSquare  26  // => false

- Isograms:

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram.
Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
Example: (Input --> Output)
"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)
isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false

- Exes and Ohs:

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's.
The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.
Examples input/output:
XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false

- Jaden Casing Strings:

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as
The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013).
Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter.
When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.
For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith.
The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
Example:
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

- Shortest Word:

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

- Complementary DNA:

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus
of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G".
Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side.
DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).
More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)
Example: (input --> output)
"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

- Credit Card Mask:

Usually when you bought something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number 
or answer to your most secret question is still correct. 
However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.
Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
Examples
"4556364607935616" --> "############5616"
     "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"
               "1" -->                "1"
                "" -->                 ""
// "What was the name of your first pet?"
"Skippy" --> "##ippy"
"Nananananananananananananananana Batman!" -->"####################################man!"
